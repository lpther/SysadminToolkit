SysadminToolkit - Easily create CLIs from your many and specialized scripts and tools
=====================================================================================

Terminology:
	label		: full command, ex: "display system uptime"
	keyword		: a word from a label, separated from a <space>. Must not 
				  contain a special character (see below)
	
Reserved labels:
	"mod ..."				: restrict the scope of the following label to one plugin (later)
	"help <pluginname>"		: display the plugin's main help (later)
	"exit ..."				: exits current mode, go back to previous mode if available (later)
	"quit ..."				: exits to shell (later)
	"set ..."				: change configuration during run time (later)
	
Special character meanings:
	" " (space)		: keyword separator
	?				: contextual help (later)
	<keyword>		: dynamic keyword
	\n				: execute current label
	tab				: command completion (later)
	
	Note: All other characters can be used by modules

	[x]	Plugin definition here
[x]	Support for same label, but different plugin (conflict handling)
	Sudo-like use, ex: operator account could switch to root for the scope of the CLI or the submode
[x]	Advanced logging (syslog/remote syslog)
	Plugin design philosophy
	Design document and expand documentation
	Maximize docstring usage in plugins, for easy documentation for the sysadmins ;-)
	Documentation for sysadmins for easily package toolkit with their tools

Out of scope:
